# monkegostudy
The submission from Team Monke for the NetSoc Hackathon, November 2020.

Credited Code:

Leaderboard scripts: https://github.com/SebLague/Dreamlo-Highscores

Tutorial used as rough basis for quiz: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLnnpUsxu0U

My leaderboard scripts are from a YouTube video by Seb Lague, and I have credited his Github. Looking up "Dreamlo Leaderboard" on YouTube will bring you to his videos.
For the quiz itself, I followed a tutorial from Brackey's for a True/False quiz game. I modified some his code and wrote my own code to turn the True/False system into a random-order multiple choice answering system. Nonetheless, I must credit Brackey's for his great tutorial.
